# PowerShell

Some PowerShell scripts I've written.

Because when I'm off duty, I'm a recreational Windows user.

## Remove-TargetStrings

Empty out the contents of `<target>` nodes in an XLIFF localization file. This is needed by certain translation tools to repopulate the translations.

## Combine-Playlists

Combine multiple Windows Media Player `.asx` playlist files into a single `.asx` playlist file.

## Convert-Playlist

Convert a Windows Media Player playlist into an Apple Music (iTunes) playlist.

## Rename-64bitTools

Rename the SysInternals 64-bit tools to use the original (32-bit) names.

Because 64-bit should just be the default nowadays. Just like UTF-8. Right?
